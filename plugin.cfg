description="A plugin to track options like music and sound volume, window size 
and position, and automatically remember them. Note: by itself, only tracks window 
size and position. To track other things, add them to _INIT.data and call _INIT.Save(), 
and read them from _INIT.data when _INIT.is_loaded. If _INIT.is_loaded is false, 
you can wait for the signal INIT.loaded."
